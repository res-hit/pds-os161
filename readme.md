# Repository for os161 labs of the System Programming(OS internals) course 

 # Lab2 - Implementation of System Calls and Memory allocation module
 - system calls: read, write, exit
 
 # Lab3 - Implementation of Synchronization primitives (kernel side)
 - not busy waiting locks
 - not busy waiting condition variables
 
 # Lab4 - Implementation of *waitpid* system call
 - synchronization(wait and signal) between (main) kernel thread and thread derived from system call for process to exit implemented through semaphores. Can be implemented also with condition variables
